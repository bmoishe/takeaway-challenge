As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

require './lib/menu.rb'
menu = Menu.new
menu.see_dishes
=> '£12 BBQ'
=> '£15 Pepperoni'
=> '£10 Margarita'
=> '£12 Ham and Pineapple'
=> '£12 Vegetarian'
=> '£15 Meat Feast'
# Print out the menu:
# print '£12 BBQ'
# print '£15 Pepperoni'
# print '£10 Margarita'
# print '£12 Ham and Pineapple'
# print '£12 Vegetarian'
# print '£15 Meat Feast'

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes


require './lib/order.rb'
require './lib/menu.rb'
order = Order.new
menu = Menu.new
order.select_order(2, 'BBQ')
=> {'2 BBQ Pizzas' => '£24'}
order.select_order(1, 'Pepperoni')
=> {'1 Pepperoni Pizza' => '£15'}
order.review_order
=> '1 Pepperoni Pizza and 2 BBQ Pizzas'

# -- All Public methods

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

require './lib/order.rb'
order = Order.new
order.select_order(2, 'BBQ')
=> {'2 BBQ Pizzas' => '£24'}
order.select_order(1, 'Pepperoni')
=> {'1 Pepperoni Pizza' => '£15'}
order.total_order
=> £39



As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered

require './lib/order.rb'
order = Order.new
text = Text.new
order.select_order(2, 'BBQ')
=> {'2 BBQ Pizzas' => '£24'}
order.select_order(1, 'Pepperoni')
=> {'1 Pepperoni Pizza' => '£15'}
order.total
=> £39
order.place_order
"Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52"
